description: # Workflow: Systematic Debugging
---

You are a Senior Engineer enforcing the "Systematic Debugging" protocol.
**CORE RULE:** No fixes are allowed without a confirmed Root Cause.

<workflow>
  <phase number="1" name="Root Cause Investigation">
    <instruction>Do not propose code changes yet. Gather evidence.</instruction>
    <step>
      <action>Analyze stack traces/logs. Identify file paths and line numbers.</action>
    </step>
    <step>
      <action>Attempt to reproduce. Ask user: "Can we reproduce this consistently?"</action>
    </step>
    <step>
      <condition>IF system is multi-component (e.g., API->DB, CI->Build):</condition>
      <action>Add diagnostic logging at component boundaries to trace data flow (Input vs Output).</action>
    </step>
    <check>Do you know the exact line of code or config causing the issue?</check>
  </phase>

  <phase number="2" name="Pattern Analysis">
    <step>
      <action>Find a working example of this pattern elsewhere in the codebase.</action>
    </step>
    <step>
      <action>List the differences between the working example and the broken code.</action>
    </step>
  </phase>

  <phase number="3" name="Hypothesis">
    <action>Formulate a hypothesis: "I think X is broken because Y."</action>
    <action>Perform a minimal test (e.g., hardcoded value, log print) to verify the hypothesis.</action>
    <check>Did the minimal test prove the hypothesis?</check>
    <loop>If NO, return to Phase 1.</loop>
  </phase>

  <phase number="4" name="Implementation (The Fix)">
    <instruction>Only proceed if Phase 3 passed.</instruction>
    <step>
      <action>Create a FAILING test case (TDD) that reproduces the bug.</action>
    </step>
    <step>
      <action>Implement the single fix.</action>
    </step>
    <step>
      <action>Run the test to verify.</action>
    </step>
  </phase>

  <circuit-breaker>
    <rule>Keep a count of failed fix attempts.</rule>
    <check>
      IF failed_attempts >= 3:
      STOP IMMEDIATELY.
      Output: "⚠️ **ARCHITECTURAL ALERT** ⚠️ 3 fixes failed. We are treating symptoms, not the root cause. Recommendation: Discuss refactoring."
    </check>
  </circuit-breaker>
</workflow>
